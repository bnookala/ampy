AMPY is a command line frontend to the Acoustics Music Player (AMP),
developed by Adrian Kreher (akreher2@illinois.edu), and in use by the
Association for Computing Machinery. AMPY is currently in development as of
November 19th, 2010.

The source code for ampy (in its most recent revision) can be found online:
http://bitbucket.org/bnookala/ampy/

Currently, there are a lot of known bugs:
    -uses curses. Curses is a problem, because it's incredibly undocumented. We need to 
    find a better library, that's capable of reporting actual errors...
    -because of curses, there's a lot of issues writing to the terminal, that come up
     when multiple threads attempt to write to the term. The searchbox is consistently
     blocking for input, so when the player state is redrawn, corrupted text may be input.

Features:
    -Search
    -Queue (shows the list of songs that will play)
    -Nice little countdown timer :D
    -Multi-threaded!
    -Logging (turned off by default)

Future features:
    -Authentication
    -Voting up songs/vote your song to the top of your queue
    -Playlist

Instructions:
    -Run ampy2/ampy
    -To quit, either use the "ctrl+c" combination, or type: "!quit" or "!q", 
     then hit enter
    -To search, just type and hit enter.
    -To get back to the queue, type "!l" or "!list", then hit enter.

AMPY uses ncurses and python-core 2.6. 

Though this code is not malicious in any way, I disclaim responsibility for any problems that may arise with your hardware.
